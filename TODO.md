- [ ] Load options from JSON files?
- [ ] Add robustness
	- [ ] if target group exists, delete
	- [ ] if rules exists, delete
- [ ] Test with circle
- [ ] Do we need grace period?
- [ ] Create custom log groups
- [ ] Command should be optional - should use the dockerfile by default
- [ ] Do find/replace on task definition instead of setting JSON? (So custom task definition does not get overridden?)
